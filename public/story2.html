    <p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">S</span>he holds the small piece of paper and feels her body trembling. Roxana Gir&oacute;n, 16, recognizes some of the words in English but does not grasp the meaning of the sentences they form.</p>

    <p class="intro">The school year had just begun, and the ninth-grader was asked to read aloud in her geography class.</p>

    <p class="intro">Suddenly, she hears a classmate, a native English speaker, showing her how to pronounce the words.</p>

    <p class="intro">Roxana can&rsquo;t remember what she read but does not forget that someone rescued her.</p>

    <p>Being new is &ldquo;hard, it&rsquo;s very hard,&rdquo; she says.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll always encounter rocks on your path, but, in the long run, if you work hard you&rsquo;ll get what you want,&rdquo; her mother, Ang&eacute;lica Castro, adds.</p>

    <p>Roxana just wants to feel safe, far away from the mistreatment she endured in El Salvador. She wants to be with her mom. She wants to one day be a hairdresser.</p>

    <p>It all depends on legally staying in the U.S.</p>

    <h5>Crossing the border</h5>

    <p>Roxana remembers wearing a white sweater when she crossed the U.S. border on Aug. 17, 2015.</p>

    <p>She was 15 and entered through the Rio Grande Valley. She was part of a surge of immigrant children and teens from Central America.</p>

    <p>She was placed under custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement and transferred to a government shelter for unaccompanied children and teens near Corpus Christi.</p>

    <p>Once there, she said she wanted to learn English and math. She was also seen by a mental health specialist.</p>

    <p>After two weeks, Roxana was sent to Dallas. The refugee office offered her guidance to find legal representation, mental health services and other community resources.</p>

    <p>In Roxana&rsquo;s file, a specialist from Southwest Key, a contractor that runs shelters, wrote: &ldquo;The minor needs mental health services due to ... [suicidal thoughts] in 10 different occasions.&rdquo;</p>

    <h5>Tough life</h5>

    <p>Roxana knows about absence and separation. She has experienced a chain of departures.</p>

    <p>Her father left when she was 4. She was attached to him, but as time went by, she stopped waiting for his return.</p>

    <p>Then, one day in September 2012, her mother also left. Roxana woke up in the bed she shared with her mom. But she was not there. The mother didn&rsquo;t have the strength to say goodbye.</p>

    <p>Castro came to the U.S. because she couldn&rsquo;t raise Roxana and her brother on her $5-a-day job cleaning houses, she said.</p>

    <p>A maternal aunt took Roxana in. But she routinely humiliated and insulted her, making Roxana do household chores, the teen and her mother said.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;She told me I didn&rsquo;t know how to babysit her kids,&rdquo; Roxana recalled. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t let me speak with my mother; she punished me.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Family should be about caring, being stronger together, but it&rsquo;s not like that,&rdquo; the teen said.</p>

    <p>As time went by, she missed her mother even more.</p>

    <p>And then, a new separation.</p>

    <p>Roxana and her brother, then 18, hired coyotes to take them to the U.S. But he was intercepted at the border, and since he&rsquo;s no longer a minor, he was sent to a detention center. He&rsquo;s already back in El Salvador, the family said.</p>

    <h5>Salvador nightmare</h5>

    <p>Roxana&rsquo;s repaired denture is a reminder that something else happened in El Salvador, she says.</p>

    <p>Sitting very close to her mom in the living room of her new house in Dallas, in a quiet neighborhood of brick houses, Roxana speaks softly.</p>

    <p>She had just left her school in San Miguel, in eastern El Salvador, when a group of tattooed men began chasing her. They wore baggie pants and baseball caps, as gang members typically do in El Salvador, the teen said.</p>

    <p>She ran, tripped over a rock and fell. She stood up and continued fleeing until she found refuge in a grocery store. The men left.</p>

    <p>Her lip started to swell, and when she looked in the mirror, part of a front tooth was no longer there. After that incident, she began feeling terrified.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I was afraid to go out,&rdquo; she said.</p>

    <p>El Salvador is called the &ldquo;Murder Capital of the World.&rdquo; International gangs MS-13 and Barrio 18, exported from Los Angeles, dominate areas of the country.</p>

    <p>Roxana stopped going to school. According to the local digital news outlet El Faro, thousand of students have dropped out because of security concerns in El Salvador, a country of 6.3 million people, less than the population of the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You have to take into account that when those men have you as their target, there is no way out,&rdquo; Castro said.</p>

    <h5>Reuniting with mom</h5>

    <p>After being released from the shelter, Roxana landed in DFW International Airport. She had been away from her mother for four years and didn&rsquo;t immediately recognize her. Roxana had to look at her twice before embracing her.</p>

    <p>She went to live with her mother and her boyfriend, Ramiro Varela. A month after she moved into their apartment in Bedford, Varela&rsquo;s daughter also arrived from El Salvador, asking for asylum.</p>

    <p>Around that time, Castro gave Roxana a golden chain with a crystal heart pendant.</p>

    <p>She noticed Roxana was reserved.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The little girl I left, happy, bubbly, was not the same,&rdquo; Castro said. &ldquo;Her eyes were sad; you could see the sadness in her face.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Roxana missed her grandparents and her brother. She thought about her aunt and the sadness overwhelmed her, said the brown-eyed teen with thick eyelashes.</p>

    <p>The teen was referred to get help from a mental health specialist.</p>

    <p>Children who experience trauma, especially on multiple occasions, are at greater risk of having difficulties in school, suffering physical and mental problems, struggling with substance abuse or even dying prematurely, experts say.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The price of not doing anything is that we are setting this children up for potentially a lifetime of very difficult circumstances regardless of where they end up living,&rdquo; said David Murphey, senior researcher at the nonprofit Child Trends. It recently published the report &ldquo;Moving Beyond Trauma: Child Migrants and Refugees in the United States.&rdquo;</p>

    <h5>Deportation order</h5>

    <p>In August, after the family moved to a bigger house in Dallas, Roxana got a deportation order.</p>

    <p>She had failed to attend a court hearing in the removal process against her, the order said.</p>

    <p>She was terrified, fearing yet another separation.</p>

    <p>Castro and Roxana were perplexed. They were sure they had gone to every hearing. Roxana was hoping to receive a special visa for juveniles who have been abandoned by at least one parent.</p>

    <p>A lawyer with the nonprofit organization Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services is representing Roxana through a federal grant. The funds, expected to cover direct legal services for 8,000 young immigrants nationwide, were given to organizations in nine areas with the largest concentration of unaccompanied minors. Dallas is one of them.</p>

    <p>Roxana feels she&rsquo;s been lucky. More than half of juveniles in Dallas immigration court don&rsquo;t have legal representation.</p>

    <p>The lawyer, Jennifer de Haro, found that the court had made a mistake in Roxana&rsquo;s case. The removal order was canceled, she said.</p>

    <p>Then, in October, good news came when Roxana was granted a visa.</p>

    <h5>Safely in school</h5>

    <p>An avalanche of backpacks takes over the hallways of Duncanville High School when the bell rings. Roxana, who&rsquo;s only 4-foot-5, has learned to navigate the tide of teenagers to be in class on time.</p>

    <p>Her teachers describe her as a student with promise.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Very quiet and works hard,&rdquo; said Annette Valenzuela, her art instructor.</p>

    <p>Roxana wishes Valenzuela&rsquo;s class could last longer.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;She will do very well when she comes out of her shell,&rdquo; said her English teacher, Linda Kindred.</p>

    <p>Roxana said sometimes she feels she just can&rsquo;t learn the language fast enough. She&rsquo;s frustrated when U.S.-born Hispanic students, who are fluent in Spanish, answer her in English.</p>

    <p>A year has passed, however, and now it&rsquo;s easier to make friends. A classmate hugs her when they meet in Kindred&rsquo;s class for English learners. Even though she&rsquo;s at a new school district, she&rsquo;s not sitting alone in the cafeteria.</p>

    <p>The teen is also communicating better with her mother.</p>

    <p>As a report from ACH child and family services in Fort Worth states, Roxana is &ldquo;focusing on school&rdquo; and &ldquo;talking to mom once a day about her day.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Castro works on weekends, cleaning rooms at a hotel but they try to catch up when she gets home at night or has a day off.</p>

    <p>Roxana lies down on her mother&rsquo;s bed for a little while. But it&rsquo;s never as long as when they shared a bed in El Salvador.</p>
