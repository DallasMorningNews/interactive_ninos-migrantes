    <p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">C</span>&eacute;sar cried with all the force of his 34 pounds.</p>

    <p class="intro">After almost a month traveling about 1,500 miles in trucks, after spending days and days hiding in strangers&rsquo; houses, after asking over and over about the mother he hadn&rsquo;t seen in almost a year, he was now going to be separated from his father, Elimelec Cuatro.</p>

    <p>On Aug. 20, in the midst of a record surge of Central American families crossing the U.S. border, Cuatro turned himself in to the Border Patrol at Hidalgo.</p>

    <p>Cuatro says he told agents he was afraid of returning to his native El Salvador. When asked if he had been deported before, he said yes. Now, the father was being sent to a detention center. C&eacute;sar could reunite with his mom in Dallas, he was told.</p>

    <p>Cuatro tried to calm down his 4-year-old son. He was going to see his mother soon, he told the boy.</p>

    <p>As C&eacute;sar was taken away, his father wept.</p>

    <h5>In the Valley</h5>

    <p>C&eacute;sar was sent to a government shelter in Weslaco.</p>

    <p>On Aug. 21, a Customs and Border Patrol Officer signed a form stating she told the boy, in Spanish, that he was going to have to appear in front of an immigration judge to fight his removal. The document warned he could get a deportation order if he didn&rsquo;t show up.</p>

    <p>The child was also told he had the right to have an attorney, but the government was not paying for it. He was given a list of organizations in Harlingen that provide free legal assistance, according to official documents given to his mother.</p>

    <p>But in another form, the box that says &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a hearing before a judge&rdquo; is checked. According to the signing CBP agent, the document was read to the child in English.</p>

    <p>If this is confusing, imagine a 4-year-old trying to navigate the system.</p>

    <h5>All by himself</h5>

    <p>&ldquo;Yo solito me vine,&rdquo; (I came by myself), Ana Varela recalls his son telling her when he was still at the Weslaco shelter.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What about your father?&rdquo; his mother asked him.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;He left,&rdquo; the boy replied.</p>

    <p>Cesarito, as she calls him, also said he didn&rsquo;t cry when he was separated from his father.</p>

    <p>Varela was told he was the youngest at the shelter.</p>

    <p>While there, the boy had classes in Spanish and English instruction, according to a summary report of his stay prepared by International Educational Services, a nonprofit that contracts with the government to house unaccompanied minors along the Texas border.</p>

    <p>The 4-year-old boy got C&rsquo;s in math, social studies and physical education. And B&rsquo;s in science, English and home economics. His effort was considered &ldquo;Excellent.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>On Aug. 22, he was given at least six vaccines, but his doctor visits were not over.</p>

    <p>C&eacute;sar, who had been hospitalized for breathing problems in El Salvador, had a pesky dry cough. He was diagnosed with variant asthma (without the wheezing) and gastroesophageal reflux disease, a digestive disorder, according to medical records.</p>

    <p>When he was released after spending almost two weeks at the facility, C&eacute;sar signed with his fingerprints a statement promising to &ldquo;actively participate in his security and well-being.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He kept a notebook decorated with PAW Patrol stickers and filled with blank pages.</p>

    <h5>Mom leaves</h5>

    <p>The last time C&eacute;sar saw his mother before she left to the U.S., Varela told him she had a doctor&rsquo;s appointment. Varela knew he would not ask to go with her because he&rsquo;s terrified of doctors.</p>

    <p>Varela said she fled El Salvador because gang members were harassing her. In a police report dated October 10, 2015, and filed in the southern San Vicente department, she testified that earlier that day a local leader from Barrio 18, an international criminal group initially formed in Los Angeles, told her she had two days to move in with him or he was going to cut her into pieces, as he had done with other women.</p>

    <p>The man pointed a gun to her head while another one restrained her, the 27-year-old garment factory worker said. Varela also alleged it was not the first time she had been threatened by pandilleros, or gang members.</p>

    <p>After that, her father helped her hire a coyote to come to the U.S. with her 9-month-old daughter, Estelita. The baby learned to crawl on their way to Texas, while C&eacute;sar stayed behind.</p>

    <h5>Risky crossing</h5>

    <p>Varela crossed the Rio Grande in a raft in November of 2015 and, along with Estelita, was put in U.S. custody. A monitoring device was slapped on Varela&rsquo;s ankle before she was allowed to live with her father, Ramiro, in Bedford.</p>

    <p>She had not shared a roof with him since she was as old as Estelita.</p>

    <p>At his apartment, she met her father&rsquo;s girlfriend, Ang&eacute;lica Castro, and her 16-year-old daughter, Roxana, who a month before had arrived from El Salvador, also fleeing violence.</p>

    <p>They all later moved to a bigger home in Dallas, where the daughters shared their fears of being deported.</p>

    <p>Varela is planning to seek asylum for her and Estelita. She&rsquo;s trying to find legal representation for C&eacute;sar through local organizations. No one in the family has an attorney.</p>

    <p>Lawyers agree that asylum cases are costly and difficult to win. So far, in less than 5 percent of the resolved cases in the &ldquo;adult with children&rdquo; category in Dallas, the families have been been allowed to stay, according to data from the last three years obtained by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.</p>

    <p>However, about half of the cases introduced since 2014 are pending.</p>

    <p>Immigration courts have a record backlog of half a million cases nationwide, which means longer processing times. In Dallas, judges were scheduling asylum hearings until 2018.</p>

    <p>Local nonprofits have not taken Varela&rsquo;s or her children&rsquo;s case, saying there&rsquo;s no protection available for them. Varela can&rsquo;t afford the thousands of dollars a lawyer would charge her. Instead, she asked a paralegal/notary public to fill her asylum request for $600.</p>

    <p>There is little help for these Central American families in Dallas. The nonprofit Catholic Charities offers a workshop of last resource where pro bono lawyers assist them filing asylum applications.</p>

    <p>If Varela&rsquo;s chances of obtaining immigration relief are very low, they seemed even more remote for Cesar&rsquo;s father. He had been apprehended and sent back to El Salvador twice before.</p>

    <p>From the South Texas detention center in Pearsall, Cuatro said he left because gangs were also threatening him. He said he was harassed when he went to work at a shoe factory and had to cross an area controlled by the MS-13 gang, an international criminal organization, to another under Barrio 18&rsquo;s dominion.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I was threatened three times. The last one I got a piece of paper saying they were going to kill me,&rdquo; Cuatro said in a phone call.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of going back, and if I&rsquo;m deported, I won&rsquo;t be able to see my baby girl either, after a year without seeing her face to face,&rdquo; he added.</p>

    <p>At the end of October, however, he signed a government document agreeing to go back to El Salvador, Varela said. She didn&rsquo;t know if he is being deported or was given the option of a voluntary departure.</p>

    <h5>In Dallas</h5>

    <p>In his grandfather&rsquo;s home in Dallas, C&eacute;sar plays with his favorite toy: a red firefighter truck with a white staircase. He laughs, throwing his head back when the red truck crashes with one of his other miniature cars, like a blue one with Mickey Mouse and Goofy.</p>

    <p>Varela says C&eacute;sar was spoiled by his grandmother in El Salvador after she left and now he&rsquo;s more rebellious. Sometimes the boy tells her he wants to go back to his grandma.</p>

    <p>Last month, C&eacute;sar entered a bilingual prekindergarten program in a public school in Dallas. Varela tries to help him with his homework, but she has trouble understanding instructions in English.</p>

    <p>She&rsquo;s doing even worse with the nearly 175 pages of medical and legal documents C&eacute;sar got when he was released from the government shelter, even though some pages are in Spanish. She scatters them over her lap, looking overwhelmed.</p>

    <p>Sitting on a couch, under a panoramic photo-poster of Dallas, Varela worries about the father of her children. She shows a video he made with photos she sent him when being together again seemed likely.</p>

    <p>It opens with the title mis tesoros, my treasures. Estelita can be seen growing from one picture to the next. The girl is already walking.</p>

    <p>In the video, the singer croons &ldquo;por favor, no crezcas m&aacute;s,&rdquo; please stop growing.</p>
