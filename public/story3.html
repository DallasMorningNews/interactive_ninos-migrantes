    <p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">D</span>ozens of students spill out of the school bus under a cloudy sky.</p>

    <p class="intro">As Antonio waits for the exit of a friend in a wheelchair, a few raindrops fall this early June morning. The two head into Main Event Entertainment in Grapevine, an indoor arcade with pool tables and bowling.</p>

    <p>It&rsquo;s a celebration for the end of the school year at Irving ISD&rsquo;s Newcomer Academy. The students just completed a school year in an American high school &mdash; a distinction for these young immigrants whose education was interrupted.</p>

    <p>Antonio, who asked that his surname not be used, came to the U.S. when he was 16, as one of more than 260,000 minors who&rsquo;ve crossed the southern border in the last three years, sometimes alone, sometimes with their parents. Most are from El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico.</p>

    <p>His counselor at the Newcomer Academy, Katherine Hern&aacute;ndez, is proud of him for completing ninth grade. But Hern&aacute;ndez suspects the student, now 18, might not be back in August.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;My biggest concern is that they continue with their education because they&rsquo;ve had gaps,&rdquo; Hern&aacute;ndez said. &ldquo;I don't want to see them working in the fast food industry and that type of thing, I want them to be far more successful that they ever dreamed of.&rdquo;</p>

    <h5>Early adulthood</h5>

    <p>Like many of the immigrant students trying to win stuffed animals at the arcade at Main Event, Antonio was pushed into adulthood.</p>

    <p>Some weeknights and weekends the teen works odd jobs to pay the money he borrowed when he hired a coyote, or smuggler, to come north.</p>

    <p>One day, he went to school still covered with grease after working late in an auto repair shop. He hadn&rsquo;t had time to shower.</p>

    <p>About half of the students at the Newcomer Academy work, according to Hern&aacute;ndez&rsquo;s estimates</p>

    <p>Many said their American dream is being able to help the families they left behind.</p>

    <h5>Dissed by his father</h5>

    <p>Antonio lived in Usulut&aacute;n, in eastern El Salvador. His father left when he was still a toddler. He waited for his return. Then, one day, someone broke his heart by telling him his father denied Antonio was his son. Resentment swelled.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m bitter because I&rsquo;m too sentimental,&rdquo; the teen said.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, Antonio&rsquo;s birth certificate lists his father. The man, identified as a jornalero, or day laborer, didn&rsquo;t sign the document because he didn&rsquo;t know how, the document says.</p>

    <p>Antonio was 12 when his grandfather taught him how to climb coconut trees and clean corn to earn money.</p>

    <p>In El Ojuste, a rural area in Usulut&aacute;n, his mother was so sick at times with anemia, high blood pressure and other ailments that she stayed in bed.</p>

    <p>They were not &ldquo;hungry, hungry,&rdquo; he says of the family. There were always beans or corn. But bread was a luxury.</p>

    <p>As long as he can remember he had trouble focusing at school and suffered frequent headaches. At 15, in ninth grade, he dropped out.</p>

    <p>He briefly dreamed of owning an auto shop. He soon realized that gangs were targeting businesses asking for la renta, or extortion money.</p>

    <p>That&rsquo;s the reality of the country of his childhood, a country suffering the legacy of a 30-year-old civil war and crippling poverty.</p>

    <p>In Antonio&rsquo;s town, turf wars worsened between Salvadoran criminal groups MS-13 and Barrio 18, international gangs originally from Los Angeles, resulting in one of the highest crime rates in the hemisphere. In 2015, El Salvador had 103 homicides per 100,000 residents.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to be part of the rivalry because it&rsquo;s not something good,&rdquo; he said.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The [expletives] came looking for me several times.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The last time a gang tried to recruit him he moved to a different town, but he was always on alert and couldn&rsquo;t sleep. Unfamiliar noises made him jump out of his hammock.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I was still afraid,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You always have that on your mind and how can you forget what&rsquo;s already on your mind?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>An August report by a United Nations agency compiled testimonies from Central American migrant children, similar to Antonio&rsquo;s.</p>

    <p>A 17-year-old Salvadoran teen told UNICEF he had dropped out of school because of threats in his gang-run neighborhood. Another teen said that her 12 year-old cousin had joined a criminal group.</p>

    <p>In January 2015, Antonio decided to head north. He knew the journey included crossing three international borders &mdash; Guatemala, Mexico and the United States &mdash; and it was dangerous, but he left anyway. He carried $20 and a medallion of the Virgin of Guadalupe on his neck for protection.</p>

    <h5>Caught in Texas</h5>

    <p>After crossing three borders, Antonio was caught in Texas and sent to a government shelter in Miami. He turned 17 in custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, surrounded by children and teens that, like him, came to the country without their parents.</p>

    <p>An aunt he hadn&rsquo;t seen for years agreed to take care of him.</p>

    <p>In March, he arrived in Dallas, where a record snowfall carpeted the streets.</p>

    <p>At his aunt&rsquo;s house in Irving, he spent his first days throwing snowballs. He walked out in a tropical outfit, just shorts and a T-shirt. He wanted to feel the cold, to test how long he could endure it.</p>

    <p>Highways amazed him. When he earned enough to buy a cellphone with a camera, he recorded the cars passing by at high speed.</p>

    <p>In his Salvadoran town there was only one freeway and he couldn&rsquo;t afford a phone with a camera, he said.</p>

    <p>The teen with spiky black hair also saved photos he took with his Newcomer Academy counselor.</p>

    <p>He likes Miss Hern&aacute;ndez because they could talk about their lives, and she didn&rsquo;t correct him in front of other students when he made mistakes while speaking English. He would even bring her Kisses chocolate candy.</p>

    <p>He got encouragement by winning an award for improving his English at the end of the school year.</p>

    <p>He used to practice the language watching YouTube videos. But adjusting to Texas has been &ldquo;very hard,&rdquo; he said.</p>

    <p>In El Salvador he didn&rsquo;t need a car to move around or go to the soccer field, he said.</p>

    <p>In Texas, with limited English, it&rsquo;s different. Antonio feels judged by how much he earns or what he owns. Over there, he didn&rsquo;t need a cellphone to organize a soccer game, he just whistled loudly and a team appeared on a field.</p>

    <p>But he wouldn&rsquo;t still be alive, he thinks, had he stayed in El Salvador.</p>

    <p>Just the same, he&rsquo;s divorced himself from contact with many of his friends in El Salvador. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all in gangs, and I said I was going to distance myself from la vida loca,&rdquo; the gangs&rsquo; crazy lifestyle.</p>

    <p>Antonio likes to make jokes, but his honey eyes seldom light up.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always laughing and it&rsquo;s all the same for me, but yeah, I&rsquo;m sensitive. It&rsquo;s the same when I&rsquo;m mad and I laugh, and I&rsquo;m not laughing because I&rsquo;m happy,&rdquo; he said.</p>

    <p>Two of his recent Whatsapp profile pictures included these messages:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I learned to live like a clown, laughing on the outside but torn to pieces inside.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Sometimes we cry not because we&rsquo;re weak but because we&rsquo;re tired of being strong.&rdquo;</p>

    <h5>A sick mother</h5>

    <p>Antonio&rsquo;s mother has been sick for years, the teen and his aunt said. She had a tumor, and her uterus was removed before Antonio celebrated the end of the school year.</p>

    <p>His aunt and uncle wired her money for her medical expenses.</p>

    <p>One blood transfusion costs about $50 and she had at least five, Antonio said.</p>

    <p>His relatives also lent Antonio money for the coyote that brought him to the U.S. and for the Texas lawyer who&rsquo;s fighting his deportation proceedings.</p>

    <p>The 18-year-old&rsquo;s debt? About $6,000.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s responsible for paying back that money,&rdquo; because his mother already had to take a second and third mortgage on her house, said Mar&iacute;a, Antonio&rsquo;s aunt.</p>

    <p>However, Mar&iacute;a says she wants Antonio to learn English and finish school first so that &ldquo;he can be somebody in this country.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>She didn&rsquo;t have that opportunity, she said, as four children under 7 years old &mdash; two of her own &mdash; watched cartoons in the living room of her Irving house.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I tell him that he&rsquo;s still a kid, but he doesn&rsquo;t like it when I call him kid,&rdquo; his aunt said.</p>

    <p>Antonio&rsquo;s life could be in limbo, with no documents to stay or work legally in the country, but his mind is fixed on paying his debts and helping his mother. He also wants to cover his expenses, like his cellphone.</p>

    <p>If he&rsquo;s sent back to El Salvador he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to repay his relatives, he said. He used to earn about $5 a day.</p>

    <p>During the summer months, Antonio worked in roofing and tree pruning. He made between $60 and $150 per day and sent his mother money.</p>

    <h5>Out of school</h5>

    <p>But when classes began on Aug. 22, Antonio wasn&rsquo;t in school.</p>

    <p>His aunt Mar&iacute;a soon received calls from Irving ISD officials.</p>

    <p>Antonio had to go back to class or she would end up in court. School is mandatory in Texas for residents under 19, she was told.</p>

    <p>At the end of August, Antonio entered 10th grade at Nimitz High School to prevent his aunt from being fined.</p>

    <p>He says it&rsquo;s been difficult to spend most of the day in a room listening to lessons full of hard consonant sounds he does not understand, all the while thinking he must repay his debts.</p>
